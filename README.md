# My Portfolio

I consolidated all my front-end projects I built as part of my Codecademy assignment and self-learning.

A project item animation where the background of a grid item expands and the product image scales up. Based on the Dribbble shot [Surf Project](https://dribbble.com/shots/3879463-Surf-Project) by [Filip Slováček](https://dribbble.com/filipslovacek).
